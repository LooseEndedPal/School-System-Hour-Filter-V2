# School System Hour Filter V2

## What you'll need
Make sure to have JavaFX sdk and Java on your computer with an IDE such as VS code to run(Note: This program used vscode for its IDE, make sure to have the Java extension pack installed)

## Functionality
Unlike V1, V2 uses javafx to create a better user interface that allows you to manually input data one by one instead of inputting it all in one go. It also includes course names in the output even if there is more than one.

## Update log
V1.0
- Added JavaFX UI that allows user to manually input data
- Refactor methods that would work with the UI
- Refactor classes to add course names
- Changed array to Arraylist for infinite input

## Idea for changes
- Use comparable/comparator to organize the list
- Make the output look less "compressed"
- Maybe move code from the main class into another class for cleaner workspace
- Maybe profession like course so duplicates don't happen because profession was changed
